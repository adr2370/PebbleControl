# PebbleControl

This is a pebble app, iOS app, and chrome extension that allows you to scroll up and down your webpage with a pebble watch. You can also play and pause youtube videos.

#### TO DO

*   Let iOS app run in the background
*   Allow playing and pausing of other services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)
*   Figure out what to actually display on the app, both on the phone and the pebble
