# PebbleControl

This is a pebble app, iOS app, and browser extension that allows you to scroll up and down your webpage with a pebble watch. You can also play/pause youtube and pandora.

#### How to install

*   Install the pebble app the way you normally would, it is found in `PebbleAppConfigured/build/PebbleAppConfigured.pbw`
*   Run the iOS app in Xcode
*   Upload the zip file `PebbleControlExtension.zip` to a new extension on [crossrider.com](http://crossrider.com/)
*   Follow the instructions to publish it to staging
*   Click on the extension's icon and type in the number shown on the iOS app and hit enter
*   You should now be able to scroll your browser and play/pause youtube and pandora.

You can probably build the iOS app and browser extension however you want, but above is what I know works.

#### TO DO

*   Let iOS app run in the background
*   Allow playing and pausing of other services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)
